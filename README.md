# scatteringCalculator
This little tool calculates the width of the multiple coulomb scattering angle distribution using the highland formula


For some materials the radiation length is in the code. They come from this website: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/AtomicNuclearProperties/

For other materials you will have to enter it. You can look them up at the very same website.
